This app uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication. No login credentials are required - the app automatically signs in users anonymously on launch.

Main features:
1. Enter a worry/concern (10-300 characters) and select a category
2. AI generates a personalized Japanese tanka (31-syllable poem)
3. Browse other users' tankas in the feed
4. Like, report, and block functionality

Key points for review:
- Tanka generation is limited to once per day per user
- All content is AI-generated Japanese poetry (tanka format: 5-7-5-7-7 syllables)
- User-generated input (worry text) is validated by AI before processing
- Content moderation: tankas are auto-hidden after 3 reports
- No personal information is collected; all users are anonymous
- No in-app purchases or subscriptions
- Photo library access is only used to save/share tanka images

Third-party services:
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- OpenAI API (via Firebase Cloud Functions, for tanka generation)
